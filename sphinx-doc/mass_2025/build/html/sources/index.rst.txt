Overview
--------

The Meeting for Apllied Simulation Sciences (MASS) 2025 is an interdisciplinary meeting for Cardiff-based physical modellers and colleagues from the Advanced Research Computing at Cardiff (ARCCA). We hope to encourage the exhange of cutting edge computational techniques between colleagues with a diverse set of research interests (CHEMY, EARTH, ENGIN, & PHYSX). We also hope to communicate the latest developments for the HPC resources provided by ARCCA and Cardiff University.

MASS is supported by a grant provided by the Research Culture Fund 2025.

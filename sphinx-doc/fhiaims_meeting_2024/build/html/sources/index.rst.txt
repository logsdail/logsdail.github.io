Tutorials
---------

This meeting will include a number of tutorials before the main sessions of talks. The topics of these tutorials are ultimately to be driven by what attendees wish to
see tutorials on however there will be a session on the fundamentals of FHI-aims and how best to utilise the software.
Currently suggested topics include:

* A general introduction to FHI-aims
* Excited state calculations
* ASI API
* MPE implicit solvation
* Beyond DFT methods 
* Embedding

Other, more advanced tutorials may be available with enough interest and will be published here in due course.

**Full schedule TBA**

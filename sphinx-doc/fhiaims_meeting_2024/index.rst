Accommodation options include a limited number of rooms available to be booked on the university campus for attendees through `Warwick Conferences <https://warwick.ac.uk/services/conferences/bed-and-breakfast/>`_.
Alternatively, accommodation is generally available within Coventry city (a short bus ride from the campus).

Travel to the University of Warwick is achieved easily through rail connections to **Coventry station** and then a bus journey from outside the station to the campus.
More information about how to get to the university can be found on the `university website <https://warwick.ac.uk/about/visiting/directions/>`_.

Tutorials
---------

.. This meeting will include a number of tutorials before the main sessions of talks. The topics of these tutorials are ultimately to be driven by what attendees wish to
.. see tutorials on however there will be a session on the fundamentals of FHI-aims and how best to utilise the software.
.. Currently suggested topics include:
.. 
.. * A general introduction to FHI-aims
.. * Excited state calculations
.. * ASI API
.. * MPE implicit solvation
.. * Beyond DFT methods 
.. * Embedding
.. 
.. Other, more advanced tutorials may be available with enough interest and will be published here in due course.
.. 
.. **Full schedule TBA**

.. .. include:: tutorials.rst

Tutorials will run in a linear fashion form 09:00 to 12:00 on May 15th, with a coffee break at 10:00. The tutorials will cover, in order; an introduction to FHI-aims, hybrid DFT (including a discussion on performance optimisation), RPA and GW. Simultaneously, there will also be expert offshoots to discuss particular methods or topics. 

The sessions will be hands-on and require a precompiled FHI-aims binary and license. Instructions for obtaining the software can be found `on the FHI-aims webpage <https://fhi-aims.org/get-the-code-menu/get-the-code/>`_, and any license requirements should be completed prior to arrival. Support will also be available onsite from MS1P. 

Hack
----

Following the presentation schedule of the meeting, all attendees are invited to a code hack, wherein the developers of the codebase will get together and take part in some
collaborative coding. The organisers would like to invite anyone with a suggestion for features to be included in FHI-aims to discuss these at the meeting with the
developers. `Ideas for topics to address can be logged on a GitLab issue here <https://aims-git.rz-berlin.mpg.de/aims/FHIaims/-/issues/549>`_.

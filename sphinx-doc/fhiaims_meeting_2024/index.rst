Overview
--------

The FHI-aims User and Developer Meeting aims to unite both the users and developers of FHI-aims to delve into to and exchange ideas
on the applications and effects of FHI-aims within institutions in the United Kingdom. The event will also showcase the latest
features and advancements in the software.

Time and Place
--------------

The meeting will take place at `The University of Warwick <https://warwick.ac.uk/>`_ from **May 15th to May 16th 2024**.
Talks are scheduled from 12:00 on the 15th to 13:00 on the 16th with tutorials preceding them (starting at 09:00 on the 15th) and a code hack
following them (from 14:00 - 18:00 on the 16th).
The venue for the meeting is the Science Concourse within the Physics Department of the University of Warwick.
Directions can be found on this `interactive campus map <https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/>`_.

Accommodation and Travel
------------------------

Accommodation options include a limited number of rooms available to be booked on the university campus for attendees through `Warwick Conferences <https://warwick.ac.uk/services/conferences/bed-and-breakfast/>`_.
Alternatively, accommodation is generally available within Coventry city (a short bus ride from the campus).

Travel to the University of Warwick is achieved easily through rail connections to Coventry station and then a bus journey from outside the station to the campus.
More information about how to get to the university can be found on the `university website <https://warwick.ac.uk/about/visiting/directions/>`_.

Tutorials
---------

This meeting will include a number of tutorials before the main sessions of talks. The topics of these tutorials are ultimately to be driven by what attendees wish to
see tutorials on however there will be a session on the fundamentals of FHI-aims and how best to utilise the software.
Currently suggested topics include a general introduction to FHI-aims, excited state calculations, ASI API, MPE implicit solvation, beyond DFT methods and embedding.
Other, more advanced tutorials will be available and will be published here in due course.

**Full schedule TBA**

Hack
----

After the closing of the main body of the meeting, all attendees are invited to a code hack, wherein the developers of the codebase will get together and take part in some
collaborative coding. The organisers would like to invite anyone with a suggestion for features to be included in FHI-aims to discuss these at the meeting with the
developers.

Overview
--------

On this page you will find a collection of resources that will help you settle in the `tamm@CCI research group <https://tamm-cci.github.io>`_. This resource is not exhaustive and suggested additions are always welcomed!

Meetings
--------

.. note:: Recognising the benefits of hybrid working, in-person attendance at the office is **expected** on Weds, **encouraged** on Tues/Thurs, and at an individuals discretion on Mon/Fri.

* | Monday each week: 10.30-11am (remote), Group dial-in and catch-up regarding all research matters - see shared Calendar.

* | Tuesday each week: **project meetings** (in-person or remote), please organise via Outlook Calendar, inviting all necessary participants. Meeting length is at the discretion of the organiser.

.. note::   Meetings are **expected** at minimum frequency every week for undergraduate students; and every two weeks, with availability for every week, for postgraduate students and staff.
            For postgraduates and staff, **if a meeting is not held on a given week**, an update is expected via email (for official logging).

* | Wednesday each week: 10.30-11.30am (in-person expected), Group in-person hack, working on individual/collaborative code issues - alternates between tamm@CCI and `all TRH 0F Research Groups <https://cf.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/TRHComputationalChemistryMeetings/Shared%20Documents/General/Upskilling?csf=1&web=1&e=yBllMv>`_.

.. _Tools:

Tools
-----
* `Slack <https://join.slack.com/t/tamm-cci/shared_invite/zt-9qqnftiv-bPRJ_H~I45bt3kVZzoxiww>`_ : Communication platform for the group.

* `Trello <https://trello.com>`_ : Project planning platform - prompt Andy to setup a board for your project if necessary.

* Also prompt Andy (via email to LogsdailA@cardiff.ac.uk) to organise keycard access for your office!

* `GitHub <https://github.com/tamm-cci/carmm/>`_ : For those keen to engage with software development, our scripts/software are stored here. Tutorial examples are also available `here <https://github.com/tamm-cci/external_examples>`_.

.. note:: If you can't find a tool that does what you want online, or are creating your own scripts, someone in the group may well have worked on a similar problem before. Save yourself effort by and help our collegiate effort by joining our `GitHub <https://github.com/tamm-cci/carmm/>`_ and adding/developing the available software! An `internal folder <https://cf-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/logsdaila_cardiff_ac_uk/EpGS8SZBWH9Gi-1RAetBIb8BB1wV7KDaKAaeP-Ln4kn8XA?e=ELaqO3>`_ also exists for miscellaneous scripts/guides.

Tutorials
---------
* | `Bash <https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/>`_ : Using Bash through the terminal is the most robust way of interacting with a Unix-like system (Linux machines in the office and supercomputers). These resources should help you get started with the command line interface:

  * `Unix Crash Course <https://astrobiomike.github.io/unix/>`_
  * `Cheatsheet for Unix <https://cf-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/logsdaila_cardiff_ac_uk/EeGuxkwHZo9Hr0YTButYV2EBgJAUQHXqDX233CRwkeVZeQ?e=ygg3Ce>`_
  * Text editors `Nano <https://astrobiomike.github.io/unix/working-with-files-and-dirs>`_ (the simplest) or `vi <https://cf-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/logsdaila_cardiff_ac_uk>`_ and `emacs <https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf>`_ (more feature rich).

* `Python <https://www.python.org>`_ : Our main working environment. There are loads of tutorials out there, examples are (running from least to most interactive):

  * `Python 3 Official Documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/>`_
  * `Learn Python <https://www.learnpython.org/>`_
  * `JetBrains Edu <https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10081-edutools/docs/learner-start-guide.html?section=Introduction%20to%20Python>`_ (Good as integrates with PyCharm - see note)
  * `The Molecular Sciences Software Institute <http://education.molssi.org/resources.html>`_ (Also offer training on software development best practice)

.. note:: 
  An IDE is strongly recommended for programming. `PyCharmm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`_ is particularly nice as it integrates seamlessly with GitHub! And you might also want to consider `CodeTogether <https://www.codetogether.com/>`_ as a plugin for collaborative coding.

* `Atomic Simulation Environment <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/tutorials/tutorials.html>`_ : Our main working environment for running simulations, great for manipulating atoms.

* | `FHI-aims <https://fhi-aims-club.gitlab.io/tutorials/tutorials-overview/>`_ : Quantum mechanical software for calculating electronic structure of molecules and materials. (PDF version of tutorials `also available <https://th.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/th/meetings/DFT-workshop-Berlin2011/presentations/2011-07-13_tutorial1_handout.pdf>`_, and the manual is `online <https://cf-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/logsdaila_cardiff_ac_uk/Ec7nlupYyl9HiOrP-yzxlWsByy969L-BtTaflkitL8xGmw?e=a1junU>`_ also.)

* | `ChemShell <https://chemshell.org/static_files/py-chemshell/tutorial/build/html/index.html>`_ : A Pythonic environment for running QM/MM calculations.

.. note::
  Many training opportunities are available through the `Doctoral Training Academy <https://rssdp.cardiff.ac.uk/>`_. This includes Python (`Basic <https://rssdp.cardiff.ac.uk/index.php?sect=workshops&action=details&wid=IT068&indexKeyword=p>`_ and `Advanced <https://rssdp.cardiff.ac.uk/?sect=workshops&action=details&wid=RS200&indexKeyword=p>`_) as well as soft-skills, such as for manuscript, presentation and thesis preparation. Training is also available from `Advanced Research Computing @ Cardiff University (ARCCA) <https://arcca.github.io/>`_ on working on HPC platforms.

Computing Facilities
--------------------

The use of OneDrive is strongly recommended for all long-term data storage. If you need to transfer data from the supercomputing facilities into your OneDrive storage space, see `our notes here <https://cf-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/logsdaila_cardiff_ac_uk/EQi0c5Zlwi9JrmfeYJW9zlQBsm_3KiOv8jL20OXRhQbZTQ?e=k68k0d>`_ for data transfer from ARCHER2, which are generalisable to all platforms.

.. warning::
  For optimum efficiency when using ASE with FHI-aims, make sure to run your calculations on HPC using the sockets calculator interface. Read more in `our Jupyter notebook <https://github.com/tamm-cci/external_examples/blob/master/notebooks/ASE/sockets.ipynb>`_.

* | `Hawk <https://portal.supercomputing.wales/index.php/index/>`_ : The Welsh supercomputing facility. Documentation is `available here <https://arcca.gitpages.cardiff.ac.uk/websites/arcca-docs>`_.
  | Register to access through `this web portal <https://portal.supercomputing.wales/index.php/getting-access/>`_ and join project `SCW1057`.
  
.. note::
  * When you login, you are in your home directory: `/home/<username>/`

  * Work is done in the scratch directory only: `/scratch/<username>/`

  * Examples of how to run software is in the project shared directory: `/home/scw1057/`

  * Extensive training material, both on using Hawk and HPC in general, are provided by `ARCCA <https://arcca.github.io/>`_. For training on the SLURM queue, checkout also `this page <https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support/knowledge-base/slurm>`_.

* `Isambard <https://gw4-isambard.github.io/docs/>`_ : The Tier-2 facility accessed through the GW4 consortium.

.. note::
  * You need to login to the `XC50 sub-cluster <https://gw4-isambard.github.io/docs/user-guide/connecting.html#xci-marvell-thunder-x2>`_  to run calculations. Software and example job scripts are available at `/home/ca-alogsdail`

* `Young <https://www.rc.ucl.ac.uk/docs/Clusters/Young/>`_ and `ARCHER2 <https://www.archer2.ac.uk/>`_ : Our access is managed through the `Materials Chemistry Consortium <https://www.ucl.ac.uk/klmc/mcc/>`_, with proposal deadlines every 6 months. If you are applying for compute time, please review the group's `best practice guide and example applications <#best-practice-proposals>`_. All previously submitted applications are also listed on the MCC webpages.

.. note::
  * On Young, software and example job scripts are available at `/home/mmm0170`

  * On ARCHER2, software and example job scripts are available at `/work/e05/e05-files-log/shared`

.. warning::
   On Hawk, Isambard, Young and ARCHER2, all the Python software you need is loaded in a "virtual environment" using our submission scripts. If you want to have your own versions of software, you can setup a personal `virtual environment <https://opensource.com/article/19/4/managing-python-packages>`_ or using `pip3 install --user <modulename>` (or, if `pip3` fails, use `python3 -m pip`). Make sure you have loaded the Python module beforehand!

Administration (PhD)
--------------------
| Throughout the PhD, you'll have to do paperwork to ensure continuous progression. 
| All documents for this are on `Learning Central <https://learningcentral.cf.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_3387725_1&course_id=_368439_1>`_ under "CHEMY - Research Student Information".

If you encounter issues, the Chemistry PGR Office are available to help - just pop and say hi, or email them at Chemistry-PGR@cardiff.ac.uk.
